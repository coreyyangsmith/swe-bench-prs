It's also imported below by `try_import`.\r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\nThis line should simply be removed, because below there is a `try_import` for this as well. Also in the `check_privileges`, the non-existence of `grp` should be checked. Unfortunately due to my companies restrictions I cannot submit a MR.\r\n\r\nGit blame shows @namloc2001 and @thedrow for [this line which is still on master](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/ce567e31065e3361493ebb33a23e2f04c07cc371/celery/platforms.py#L9).\r\n\r\nThanks!\n",

        "problem_statement": "celery.schedules.crontab is_due logic can trigger periodic celery beat tasks at arbitrary times unrelated to the crontab parameters when last_run_at value is sufficiently old\nThere's an issue in the implementation of `celery.schedules.crontab` method that can cause `crontab.is_due` to claim a schedule is due at a time that is completely unrelated to the given crontab parameters. This appears to happen in cases where the `last_run_at` value is older than the most recent feasible time the schedule could have run.

This behaviour is somewhat like an undocumented variant of uncontrollable `anacron` behaviour. \"Uncontrollable\" in the sense that unlike `anacrontab`'s `START_HOURS_RANGE` parameter - there is no control at all over when tasks will be run when a scheduled execution is missed.\n\nWe experience this issue in production using the venerable Celery version of 3.1.19 : we have a celery beat process that is backed by a database using custom scheduler code that is derived from the django-celery-beat scheduler. Suppose we stop this celery beat process for some reason such as scheduled maintenance or during a deployment that needs to redeploy code to our celery cluster. When we later restart celery beat again then some or all `celery.schedules.crontab` scheduled tasks may immediately execute if there was a time during the celery beat downtime period that matches the crontab parameters.\n\nOne hack that can mitigate this behaviour is updating the \"last_run_at\" value for all celery crontab scheduled periodic tasks to the current time when celery beat starts, before celery beat makes any calls to the `celery.schedules.crontab.is_due` method.\n\n\n",
        "hints_text": "I am in the process of rewriting the `celery.schedules.crontab` logic to fix this cleanly, if i can get the green light from my client to release a fix upstream i will submit a pull request with a proposed patch to fix this within the next week or two.\r\n\r\n\n@fcostin did you ever complete your `crontab` rewrite and/or (not) get permission to release?\nCan you send a PR with proposed fix?\n@fdemmer -\r\n\r\nOne crude way to fix this is to simply revert the old change that introduced this issue: https://github.com/celery/celery/commit/4ed89ec49582b540149cf06047f091ebd20fb300 , in particular the parts of the patch to `celery/schedules.py` that introduce the much more complicated logic that estimates the time remaining until the next job.\r\n\r\nThis would have downside of breaking the logic that estimates when the next scheduled task is due, and causing the scheduler to need to poll every second to re-check if a task is due yet. But it would fix this issue.\r\n\r\nI wrote a better patch for fixing this last year (that didn't rely on polling every 1 second, and could estimate remaining time until the next scheduled task) which resolved the issue internally but finished up my contract shortly after and ran out of time to lobby for permission to release the fix upstream. I'll reach out and see if anyone there is willing to work with me to get the patch released (chances of this are low, but worth a try...).\r\n\nthanks for the response @fcostin :)\r\n\r\nmy requirement is adding tz support. i thought about rewriting/fixing/adding to celery's crontab, but decided it would be better to not hack around in that code or pile up on top, so i wrote my own using [tzcron](https://github.com/bloomberg/tzcron) to parse the cron expression and calculate the next event.\r\n\r\n- it calculates the timestamp for the next trigger based only on \"now\" (ignoring `last_run_at`), so the bug from this issue _should_ be fixed.\r\n- the cron parameters can be passed as string or separate args, in the order requested in #4570\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/fdemmer/7551bff2bab80b56aac5018060aded55\r\n\r\nit hasn't been used a lot and has no tests, but _seems_ to work and is licensed under MIT like all my gists.\nhi @fdemmer -- adding timezone support sounds like a great idea, as does your implementation that avoids using the existing celery crontab scheduler logic completely.\r\n\r\nYour `pytzcrontab` implementation looks pretty good . If i was aware of this last year that would have likely been a cleaner fix than my patch. thanks for sharing!\r\n\r\n> it hasn't been used a lot and has no tests, but seems to work and is licensed under MIT like all my gists.\r\n\r\nSounds promising!\r\n\r\nI have subjected your `pytzcrontab` class to the existing unit tests for the crontab scheduler -- with some patches to those unit tests to fix up timezones as necessary -- including adding three new tests from my patch in this issue.\r\n\r\nhere are my experimental patches, including adding `celery-tzcron.py` from your gist as `celery/scheduler_tzcron.py`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fcostin/celery/commits/scheduler_tzcron_experiments\r\n\r\nthe results are fairly good:\r\n\r\n1. `pytzcrontab` appears to fix this issue, as you predict. this makes sense.\r\n2. with a small patch for compatibility with the existing `crontab` scheduler to define `hour` ... `day_of_year` properties, `pytzcrontab` passes most of the old unit tests\r\n3. with some more patches to your `is_due` and `remaining_estimate` logic, the `pytzcrontab` implementation behaves in a closer way to how the existing `crontab` class decides when things are due. This change appears to be necessary so that `pytzcrontab` does not say the schedule is due when the schedule last ran a very short time ago (e.g. 0 seconds ago!). i am not completely happy with my proposed change here, it doesn't seem completely clean, maybe you can think of a nicer way to do it.\r\n3. `pytzcrontab` introduces one regression that the existing celery unit tests can detect-- it goes into an infinite loop if we try to schedule something on an impossible day (31st of april) . I looked for an obvious way to avoid this but didn't find a good one so i've marked the test as skipped, but this would be good to fix. I guess it could be fixed by additional up-front validation logic, but there is still some risk that a gap between validation and the behaviour of the `tzcron` library might lead to an infinite loop.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   @pytest.mark.skip(\"broken - pytzcrontab goes into an infinite loop here\")\r\n    def test_invalid_specification(self):\r\n        # *** WARNING ***\r\n        # This test triggers an infinite loop in case of a regression\r\n        with pytest.raises(RuntimeError):\r\n            self.next_ocurrance(\r\n                self.pytzcrontab(day_of_month=31, month_of_year=4),\r\n                datetime_utc(2010, 1, 28, 14, 30, 15),\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to contribute something like this as a pull request into celery itself?\nThis issue is fairly old is there a fix or a work around for this? I see the gist above but I'd rather not have to maintain some other version of celery.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm facing an issue with duplicate ETL imports because of this. I run all crontab schedules but if I make an on the fly change, either adding a new periodic task or changing the schedule of one, it will trigger ALL of my tasks to run.\nThat's very unfortunate. We're sorry that this is happening.\r\nI'm unaware of a workaround for this issue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we never received a PR which fixes this issue.\r\nIf you'd like to help, please take the patch above and do the work necessary to get it merged.\nIn all honesty this seems like its been an issue for a very long time and frankly surprised its not a much higher priority bug to be fixed. For a scheduling app to incorrectly schedule a task seems like a pretty big issue.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I appreciate you taking the time to respond. I can try to look at the code, but in all honesty I'm not very good with following large projects like Celery. If I get some time over Christmas holiday I will have a go at trying to see where it can be fixed.\r\n\r\nStay safe and have a wonderful holiday!\n> In all honesty this seems like its been an issue for a very long time and frankly surprised its not a much higher priority bug to be fixed.

I was trying to reproduce this with my app and wasn't able to reproduce it until today.\r\n\r\nThe way it triggered wasn't by adding/removing/updating a periodic task, but by adding a new schedule and then assigning that to a newly created periodic task. I don't know if this is due to the library I'm using to store it in a database or relating to this issue. I'll have to dig a bit deeper when I can.\nWe ran into this issue on our production setup and charged our subscription customers ahead of schedule when we restarted the services with a slight change in the scheduled time. This should be a higher priority bug.\r\n\r\nI will try and post the steps to reproduce this reliably.\nAs a work around: since I'm using an external scheduler library for managing the beat schedules I just simply have an event listener on beat startup null out the last_run_at field for each schedule in the database. This will prevent beat from running any of the schedules prematurely.\n> \r\n> \r\n> In all honesty this seems like its been an issue for a very long time and frankly surprised its not a much higher priority bug to be fixed. For a scheduling app to incorrectly schedule a task seems like a pretty big issue.\r\n\r\nThis is not a priority as none of us needs to fix this and no one is paying us to do so.\r\n\nI am not sure if we are experiencing this same issue, here is what the celerybeat-schedule looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> schedule = shelve.open(\"celerybeat-schedule\", writeback=True)\r\n>>> task = schedule[\"entries\"][\"My task\"]\r\n>>> task.last_run_at\r\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 5, 18, 8, 36, 0, 99, tzinfo=<UTC>)\r\n>>> task.is_due()\r\nschedstate(is_due=True, next=48.84625)\r\n>>> task.schedule\r\n<crontab: * 8 * * * (m/h/d/dM/MY)>\r\n>>> datetime.now()\r\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 5, 18, 8, 39, 36, 601785)\r\n```\r\nThe above task runs continously between 8am and 9 am __sometimes__ but not always... Using `celery==5.0.5`\n@latusaki Do you feel like investigating further?\r\nOur capacity is already maxed out with the 5.1 release.\n@binu-mobiux Do you have a way to reproduce this issue?\n@thedrow I can't commit as I don't have enough time, not expecting a fix, was just unsure if this bug is the same described above. I have now changed my crontab from 8am to 7:59 and waiting to see if the problem resurfaces. \r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nWith time set to 7:59 the task only runs once at the specified time, haven't observed the issue over the last two weeks.\nI have the same issue. I use crontab(hour='*/3') and once the top of the hour hits, it runs on an infinite loop.\n@dangell7 Do you have time to investigate or contribute a PR?",
